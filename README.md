  <strong><font size=7>An Augmented Agent - GENIEMIND</font></strong>
</b></p>
<hr>

<tt>This agent can talk, walk, and play with the users in an Augmented/ Virtual Space, alongwith actions like a real human</tt>:grin:.

<blockquote>It is solely crafted using Amazon Sumerian which is based on WebGL and integrated with Amazon Lex, Amazonm Comprehend.</blockquote>

Created as an experiment of AR/VR agent which can replace the existing boring text based chatting bots with an immersive agent with similar human reactions. I have created in a way which users can choose their agent :wink:.
