  <strong><font size=7>An Augmented Agent - GENIEMIND</font></strong>
</b></p>
<hr>

<tt>This agent can talk, walk, and play with the users in an Augmented/ Virtual Space, alongwith actions similar to a real person.</tt>:grin:

<blockquote>It is solely crafted using Amazon Sumerian which is based on WebGL and integrated with Amazon Lex, Amazonm Comprehend.</blockquote>

Site was designed and developed from scratches of "Mobirise a freeware web design application". This chatbot on AR/VR is exhibited as an experiment which can replace the existing boring text based chatting bots with an immersive agent with similar human actions, and in a way of character based on users choice.:wink:
