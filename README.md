**An Augmented Agent - GENIEMIND**

This agent can talk, walk, and play with the users in an Augmented/ Virtual Space, alongwith actions like a real human :grin:.

It is solely crafted using Amazon Sumerian which is based on WebGL and integrated with Amazon Lex, Amazonm Comprehend.

Created as an experiment of AR/VR agent which can replace the existing boring text based chatting bots with an immersive agent with similar human reactions. I have created in a way which users can choose their agent :wink:.
